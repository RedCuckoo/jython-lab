Some things that I noticed that contribute to only some of the punctuation being removed. The line for word in file: should actually be for line in file:. Python iterates over files by lines and not by words. The strip function only removes items from the beginning and end. You would use the replace function to remove characters from the middle. The way the program is currently written, it will only remove punctuation from the beginning and end of each line in the document.
